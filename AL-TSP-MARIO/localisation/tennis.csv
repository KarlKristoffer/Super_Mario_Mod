tennis_religion_DESC;The Baskites, considered quirky to some and highly dangerous to others, believe in the purity and strength of the mortal body and the mortal body alone. They hold sports in high regard for its ability to peacefully train the mortal body for whatever might oppose it. They especially revere tennis for being well-rounded in that regard and the faith has become synonymous with the famous Tennis Tournaments hosted by Sarasaland. Their name comes from the now-extinct Kingdom of Bask, the first nation to adopt Aster's teachings and laid claim to all of the Island of Bask, where Sarasaland's greatest monument to the faith, the Bask Colosseum, stands today.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

lucienism_DESC;"To expect a competition to be won by Aster-given gifts as strength and skill is unfair to the little men. Cheating is the gift the little man gives himself to balance out the blessed." \n \nLucienists, the antithesis of the ancient Baskites, worship Lucien as a god of intelligence, equality, and strategy. Lucien's followers preach the way of the mind over the way of the body and believe in doing anything, without exception, to win. Due to this deeply held view of cheating, scheming, bullying, and other such underhanded tactics as shows of piety, Lucienists are generally seen as sneaky, untrustworthy, slimy people, fit only to hang around crooks and fellow sneaks. Lucienists instead view themselves as the masters of fairness, for following the rules rewards only those with skill and leave others in the dust.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_DESC_SUBTERFUGE;To cheat is to truly level the playing field in any physical or athletic pursuit. Where honoring the rules only rewards the hard working, skilled, or gifted, cheating is an exercise of the mind and a great equalizer in all forms of competition. While others see this as dishonor, those dedicated to the idea that cheating is an act of an upright being consider this a measure of their virtue, and spiritual authorities sharing the belief agree. Like Prestige, one's proficiency in subterfuge and cheating is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

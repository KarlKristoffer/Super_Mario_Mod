species_dinohattan;Dinohattanite;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_dinohattan_desc;This creature's ancestors hail from the forsaken dimension of Dinohattan.

species_fuzzy_desc;Fuzzies are vampiric leeches that latch onto other lifeforms and consume small amounts of their blood, Vim, or life force for sustinence. Fuzzies cannot attack any form of Koopa. While indisputably sentient, the Fuzzy civilizations are primitive, tribal, and mob-based. Their leaders are called Big Fuzzies, named after the rarer super-sized Fuzzies, although most Fuzzy chieftans are not actually larger. Fuzzies are vermin by nature. Originally infesting treetops, jungles, and deep forests, they also swarm over artificial structures. When wiring, beams, and transportation platforms are erected to float in mid-air, Fuzzies will use their tree-climbing abilities to latch on them and start patrolling the wires, hoping unsuspecting prey will encounter them.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_galoomba;Galoomba;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_galoomba_desc;Galoombas are a type of Goomba that behave and look more like chestnuts or plants than the visibly fungal-based Goomabs.

Genies require a vessel in order to retain a physical form, preferring metal containers like brazen oil lamps. In the Mushroom World, genies have the power to grant wishes and are most commonly known for escourting those lucky enough to find their lamps to the location of a Power Star. The most powerful genies, respectively, are the Mushroom Djinn and the antithetical Mushroom Jeanie. All genies use the traditional folk magic of the Mushroom World, known as the white Mushroom-Kadabra and the black Fungus Pocus. Bowser, in his first true invasion of the Mushroom Kingdom, would employ Fungus Pocus to entomb the denizens of that land in blocks.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_goom_desc;This is a Goom. Bearing no relation of any sort to Goombas, Gooms are the dominant species of the Kitchen Islands and are traditionally pirates, criminals, and shady merchants. The most abundant type of Goom is the Wandering Goom, although the rarer Bandinero Gooms (which cannot produce fertile offspring with a Wandering Goom) also exist. The largest civilization of Gooms is in fact a pirate fleet under the command of Captain Syrup of the Black Sugar Gang. Gooms traditionally wield spears for ceremony and defense, but Gooms loyal to Captain Syrup are distinguished by their bandanas and use of three-pronged pitchforks.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick;Goomba;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick_desc;This is a Goomba. Goombas are among the most abundant creatures in the Mushroom World and are known for their distinctive eyebrows, fangs, and fungoid appeaarence. Goombas originally lived in peace with Toads in the Mushroom Kingdom, but the unification of Dark Land under King Bowser caused most of them to revolt and join the newfound enemy. Traditionally, Goombas were the working underclass of the Mushroom Kingdom under the middle, upper, and servile classes of Toads. Goombas, despite being as advanced as Toads, traditionally clinged to their tribal governance and deep, personal kinship with other Goombas. Goombas are extremely social creatures that form tight-knit bonds with family, friends, and brothers-at-arms. Among Koopas and Bowser's minions, Goombas are seen as the bedrock of loyalty to the Dark Land Crown and the most devoted to Bowser's cause. As the tribal governments of Goomba civilizations were diverse and had varying social conditions, no Goomba in the Koopa Troop will tell the same story as to why they rebelled.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_sarasaland_chick;Goombo;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_sarasaland_chick_desc;This is a Goombo. Goomboes are extremely closely related to Goombas, and are distinguished by their timidity, lack of eyebrows, smaller fangs, and wide, rounded caps.

species_chick_persimmon;Goombrat;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick_persimmon_desc;This is a Goombrat. Goombrats are distantly related to the Goombas but cannot breed with any other Goomba.

species_gromba_desc;Grombas are rock entities bearing extremely similar behaviors, appearences, and instincts like Goombas. They are native to the Pi'illo Islands. Most taxonomists and biologists believe that they have convergent evolution with Goombas and bare no relation or ancestor to Goombas. Unlike Galoombas, Goomboes, and Goombrats (as well as other Goomba varients), Goombas themselves do not consider them one of their own. For the purposes of this game, however, Grombas are classified with Goombas for coding and flavor purposes.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_men;Man;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x 
species_men_desc;Men, better known as Humans, are tall, prestigious, mammalian creatures with a propensity for rulership. Although the largest concentration of men is in New Donk City, as well as sizable locations in Diamond City and cultural enclaves of the Mushroom Kingdom (where the Mario Brothers grew up), the species has ruled the Mushroom Kingdom since the ascension of Princess Peach, and Sarasaland since Princess Daisy, and have ruled the seven constituent vassalages of the Mushroom Kingdom for far longer.\nAs the only significant mammalian population aside from Ukikis and Kongs, their unique traits hint at extradimensional origins: it is known that at least one other, bizzare dimension is dominated by humanity- a planet called "the earth" -and that this dimension has laws of physics and nature totally alien to reality. This world has been visted by Mario and Luigi before, but details about it are almost entirely mythical. Even the Mario Brothers can't really describe much about it aside from its exotic landmarks and bizzare physics.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

They are slower than normal Koopas and are incapable of removing their shell. Ishnail Koopas migrated from Dark Land eons ago after being rejected by the Koopas of Dark Land. The largest concentration of Ishnail Koopas in one location is in Rogueport. The Robbo Gang is the most prominant representation of Ishnail Koopas, for better or worse. Outside of the Odyssey Continents, Ishnail Koopas are among the last widespread practitioners of the indigineous, pre-Bowser Koopa paganism in the Mushroom World. Ishnail Koopas cannot breed with other Koopas.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Aside from Crocodile Island, Kremlings are also found across the Kongobongo Continent and in the conquered Northern Kremisphere.

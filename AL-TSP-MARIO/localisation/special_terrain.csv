urban;Urban;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
urban_desc;This is a large, established metropolis. Urban warfare is among the hardest tactics to employ, and any military thinking about invading and attacking standing armies within had better plead to their gods that the meat grinder only take tens of thousands.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
caldera;Caldera;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
caldera_desc;Oceans of lava, rugged fields of stone, fields of skulls and roaring fires. It may or may not be the actual caldera of an active volcano or super-volcano. This is not a pleasant place to live or fight.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
the_hand;Hand Trap;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
the_hand_desc;This narrow path is secretly guarded by gargantuan, magical hands that grab passing armies and commanders and drag them into the sprawling fortress complexes they protect. Be ready to storm castles and fight one's way out. These are among the most fortified areas in the Mushroom World. May the gods have mercy on anyone invading to attack an army in here.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
turnpike;Major Highway;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
turnpike_desc;This is a major thoroughfare for commuting and commerce by automobile, which often plays host to go-kart races that, while not impeding traffic, are very dangerous... for the go-kart drivers. This is a very bad place to place a castle and an excellent place to invade.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
athletic;Athletic Zone;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
athletic_desc;The bane of every logistician and the thing that makes a military commander wake up screaming in the night, this location is unnavigable at its base. To pass, one must instead jump and travel across gravity-defying towers comprised of sturdy mushrooms, trees, or bridges. Great chasms guarantee the deaths of anyone who slips. DO NOT attack an army that is already on top of these towers. The offensive will be like shooting Cheep Cheeps in a barrel. Go around it.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

star_hill;Star Hill;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
star_hill_desc;The Star Hill, also known as the Shooting Star Summit, is the holiest site in Astrotheology, if not the Mushroom World. Here, in  a way unlike any other place in the universe, the Star Spirits reach down from Star Haven and truly bless pilgrims with their presence. This is the base of the Star Road, and through it, to Star Haven.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
rainbow_road;Rainbow Road;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
rainbow_road_desc;The perilous and winding, supernatural paths that make up a Rainbow Road are often dangerous for armies to traverse. They are narrow enough to literally be shattered and are extremely easy for defending armies to resist invasion. The most famous, and largest, example of a Rainbow Road is the Star Road, which is the direct path from the Shooting Star Summit to Star Haven.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

badlands_desc;Rough cliffs and rugged, rocky terrain dominate the landscape, making navigation and offensive manuevers extremely difficult.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
badland_mountains;Badland Mountains;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
badland_mountains_desc;Take all of the cliffs and hazards of the Badlands biome and compound them with the heights and peril of a great mountain range. As if mountainous terrain is difficult enough to traverse, these mountain paths consist of narrow cliffs and hazards galore. The most famous example of this unforgving biome is the next-to-unnavigable Mount Rugged, but other such mountains exist elsewhere.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
mountain_pass;Mountain Pass;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
mountain_pass_desc;There are some mountains that are so steep, so dangerous, and so rugged that they are completely unnavigable. However, many of these have a narrow corridor used by travellers for millenia that is the only way through the mountain. Almost all battles fought in these narrow valleys and winding trails are decisive, one way or the other.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

wasteland_desc;Devoid of anything worthwhile and far hotter and deadlier than any desert or castle, the merciless wastes that scar the landscape of the Mushroom World cannot be navigated. Anyone who tries will always meet a Game Over.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

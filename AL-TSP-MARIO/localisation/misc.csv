canonical_character_desc;This character is an actual "Mario" series character that has appeared in officially licensed, or endorsed, content. This means that he or she has appeared, in some point, in the "greater" canon of the actual Mario video games, or the "lesser" canon of the Mario storybooks, spin-offs, and television cartoons. \nFor the purposes of the Mod, the video games are the first-party, and authoritative canon of the "Mario" universe which, whenever possible, will not be contradicted. First-party continuity will always override all other sources. \nFor the purpose of the Mod, third-party continuity will be treated as canon unless and until it is contradicted by a "Mario" series video game. Third-party content includes, as stated, storybooks and television shows, and so on. \nFor the purpose of the Mod, due to the constant contradictions, walk backs, and changes, the unoffocial commentary of Nintendo employees, including Miyamoto himself, will only be seen as a canon if it is convenient.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

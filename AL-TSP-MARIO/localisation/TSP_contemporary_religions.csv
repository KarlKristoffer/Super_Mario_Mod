# RELIGIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS #
##############################
seven_stars;Astrotheology;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
seven_stars_DESC;Astrotheology is a diverse, expansive religion that proclaims the seven benevolent Star Spirits as the supreme masters of the universe. The Star Spirits reside in the mortal coil, in a far-off place called Star Haven, that can only be reached over the Star Road, starting from Shooting Star Summit. Focused deeply on making wishes and requests to the Star Spirits, the Star Spirits can only use the full scope of their power and divinity when in possession of the Star Rod, a divine instrument that can make any wish they so choose come true. Nearly all other sentient stellar lifeforms are derived from or serve the Star Spirits, and include, in order of importance, the Grand Stars, Power Stars, Lumas (infant Power Stars), and the Star Kids. In addition to the Star Spirits and other stars, there is a host of angel-esque creatures that are revered or worshipped, such as Geno, the guardian of the Star Road, the Star Sprites, who sealed the Dark Star, and Rosalina, who shelters Lumas until they mature into Power Stars.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
rosalina_worship;Rosalina Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
rosalina_worship_DESC;This religion is centered around Rosalina, the human protector of baby Power Stars, called Lumas. A servant of the Star Spirits on the same seniority as Geno and the Star Sprites, Rosalina oversees, shelters, and guards all Lumas, Power Stars, and Grand Stars. In contrast to mainstream Astrotheology, which acknowledges Rosalina as an "archangel" of sorts under the Star Spirits, Rosalina worshippers consider Rosalina to be equal to, or superior to, the Star Spirits and even the Star Rod.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
twilight_towner_reformed;Twilight;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
twilight_towner_reformed_DESC;The reformed religion of the people of Twilight Town is organized into a traditional church structure, and centred around the worship of the source of all life, the Moon, at the Creepy Steeple.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
###Defining features in-game:\n§Y*§! The Twilit Pope may excommunicate Twilight Towner faithful \n§Y*§! The Twilit Pope may grant divorces \n§Y*§! The Twilit Pope may grant claims and sanction invasions \n§Y*§! Secular lords may not rule directly over temple holdings \n§Y*§! Only males may be priests \n§Y*§! Priests are excluded from the line of succession \n§Y*§! In the secular realm Female Twilight Towners are viewed equally to males \n§Y*§!

# Formist/Temple of Form description was primarily written by Empoleon Blownaparte, and religion concept and mechanics are his work
temple_of_form;Temple of Form;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
temple_of_form_DESC;The Temple of Form is the epicenter, spiritual nexus, and core of Formist belief, located on the outskirts of Diamond City. It is the origin and site of pilgrimage for all Formists. Grouped with absurdism in thought, Formists believe life to be meaningless and absurd from the surface to the core, and that a life focusing on "important" things, like glory and legacy, is a life wasted. To Formists, to live in the moment is to be fulfilled for eternity, and to strive for one's own ideals is the greatest ideal of all.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
power_moon_worship;Power Moon Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
power_moon_worship_DESC;Contrasted with the Power Stars are the weaker, but still important, Power Moons. They are a source of energy for many applications, divine and mundane, throughout the Odyssey continents, and, like Power Stars, are connected to both Rosalina and the Star Spirits. This religion reveres them for their unique role in the lives of so many diverse creatures, and does not reject the pantheon of Astrotheology.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
beanstar_faith;Beanstar;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
beantsar_faith_DESC;The Beanstar is a minor Star Spirit and the protector of the Beanbean Kingdom. Independent from the Star Rod, the Beanstar has the capacity to grant all wishes made unto it without discretion or discrimination to that wish's intent. Due to this potential for abuse, the Beanstar rests in a deep sleep at the behest of the Star Sprites, sealed somewhere in the Beanbean Kingdom. Only the voice of someone who is truly pure of heart can awaken the Beanstar and make their wish.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
pagan_group;Primitive;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan;Dryite Pagan;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan_DESC;Dryite Paganism refers to the ancient religion of the Dry Dry Kingdom and its inhabitants before the Criminals' Rebellion against King Mousta, which brought that realm to its end. It acknowledges the pantheon of Astrotheology but places emphasis in the divinity of the sun itself. It also reveres the mystical genies of the world, seeing them as messengers, escourts, and righteous beings.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan_reformed;Dry Dry Paganism;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan_reformed_DESC;At last, the Dryite Pagans once again control enough of Dry Dry Desert to become an international powerhouse! The reformed Dryite Pagan faith has organized its pantheon and settled theological disputes between itself and Astrotheology on the roles and purpose of the Star Spirits. The manuscripts salvaged from the Dry Dry Ruins and other archeological sites have at last been compiled into one universal canon, and an organized liturgy and priesthood now guards the truths buried beneath the sands.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
mario_party_genies_worship;Djinn Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
mario_party_genies_worship_desc;After the reformation and reorganization of Dry Dry Paganism, some dissident sects broke away after the standardization of worship of the Star Spirits and reconciliation with Astrotheology. These sects primarily declare the divinity and supremacy of the Mushroom Djinn's and other genies' wish-granting capacity to the power of the Star Rod, while seeing the Mushroom Jeanie as a force of black magic.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
piracy;Piracy;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
piracy_DESC;Pirates have but one god, and that is plunder. \nA pirate holds no allegiance to a Crown or star, has no servitude except to his own ambition, honors no virtues except towards his crew, and neber holds back on seizing the booty. For a pirate, there are two types of things in the world: that which pirates have, and that which pirates have yet to take.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
al_koopone;Organized Crime;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
al_koopone_DESC;In the cruel streets of Crime Land, behind closed blinds in Delfinite verandas at sunset, or roaming the streets of Rogueport, there exists another world that is a law unto itself. Gilded in silver duct tape, the mafias, gangs, and thief guilds of the Mushroom World honor the Koopomerta- the Oath of Silence -and cooperate as one to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Led by legends like the great Al Koopone of Crime Land (a rare example of a Bowser Koopa unrelated to Bowser himself) and the bloodthirsty Don Pianta of Rogueport and Isle Delfino, such sporadic gangs compete for glory, wealth, and enrichment. Membership is voluntary and anyone may leave the Family without worry, but may the Stars have mercy on anyone who betrays the trust and silence of "this thing of ours" when they are gone.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
movie_religion_group;Evoextradimensional;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
movie_cult;Portal Guardians;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
movie_cult_desc;Once upon a time, a great Meteorite struck the earth- long theorized to be the ancestral home world of men like the Mario Brothers and the New Donkers. This massive destruction of that planet, so the abominations claim, created a third dimension where non-sentient dinosaurs gradually came to mirror the sentient dinosaurs of Dinosaur Land, except that they took the appearence of man. That world was ransacked and polluted in a search for resources, eventually depopulating most of itself aside from the global capital. The ruler of the planet, King Reznor, was overthrown by the military under the leadership of the corrupt President Koopa (unrelated to Bowser Koopa), who promised the dinosaur men a new world on the other side./nThis monastic religion once worshipped the psychic energy created by the Meteorite, protecting it and its inhabitants by secretly controlling the Crown. However, the rise of President Koopa's junta corrupted the faith as the clergy was purged and staffed with loyalists. Now, it is but a tool to accomplish President Koopa's will.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
outlaw_witch;Witchcraft
outlaw_witch_desc;An umbrella term for those who dabble in the art of black magic, Witches are those who dive deep into things considered profane. From Tarot Readings and speaking to the dead to Summoning Demons and hexing their foes, Witches are known for their control over things deemed unholy by most faiths. One's reasoning for a Witches descent into darkness can range from the benign, belief that the divines approve of braving the profane to help others, to the truly depraved, such as a dark tyrant solidifying his rule through dark hexes and devilish sacrements, as well as everything in between. Cultures steeped in Witchcraft tend to forgo traditional morality for ideals such as power over others and knowledge of the world's deepest secrets, and even moral men who tread this dark path take pride in being feared by those who don't understand them.

STAT_PIETY_BANANAS;Bananas;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_BANANAS;Bananas Hoarded Per Month;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_BANANAS;It is the duty of every Kong and every believer in the Crystal Coconut to amass a Banana Hoard, both for the sustinence of them and their loved ones, as well as for being perceived as holy and upright. The more bananas one has harvested or seized, the more he is seen as favored in the omnipresent eyes of the Crystal Cocunut. Like Prestige, it is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_INNER_PEACE;Inner Peace;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_INNER_PEACE;Many religions do not hold any concept of 'piety', instead holding one's own contentedness and joy in life as all that matters in a faithful's life. Like Prestige, it is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_INNER_PEACE;Monthly Inner Peace Achievement;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_VIM;Taking the place of blood in reptillian and mammalian creatures, Vim is the life force of fungal-based creatures in the Mushroom World, such as Goombas, Galoombas, and most powerfully, Toads. Unlike blood, Vim is solid- no fungal creature bleeds when cut -and found within the chitin of their fungal cells. Vim only turns liquid when extracted and processed. Unlike like real world fungi, most fungal-derived creatures in the Mushroom World have a heart, although the function of it may not be as a pump. In addition to keeping fungal-based creatures alive, Vim is also a potent source for renewable energy if one knows the genetic bio-engineering to remove and proces it. \n All mechanisms and forms of internal combustion and propellant in Shroob machinery depend on Vim to function. (It also serves as a "delicious" drink for the Shroobs.) The acquisition of Vim is performed using bio-engineered trees known as toadwood: fungal creatures are forcibly lodged in the machine and slowly bled dry of their Vim, before withering into husks and, upon death, are consumed by the tree itself. While any fungal creature can have their Vim extracted, Toad Vim is the most potent and easy to harvest. \n Like Prestige, the measure of Vim extracted from innocents is added to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_VIM;Monthly Vim Extraction;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_STRENGTH;Followers of this religion value glory in combat, force of arms, and manly deeds. Proving oneself as a ruler, including obeying the law one is enforcing and being strict and ruthless on those who break it, are also prized actions in some cultures and faiths, though not neccesarily as much as demonstrating one's power. The stronger a ruler is perceived to be, the more any applicable clergymen and the general public will respect and reverently fear him. Like Prestige, it is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_STRENGTH;Monthly Strength Proven;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_WISH;This indicator is not how many wishes a worshipper of the stars or moon can have granted, but rather, one's favor with the Star Spirits or other cosmic entity. It means nothing without a righteous soul and personality, but is nonetheless greatly respected by the clergy on this mortal coil. Like Prestige, it is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_WISH;Monthly Wishing Worthiness Gains;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_EVOLUTION;Evolutionary Gains;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_EVOLUTION;The Dinohattanites are nominally men, dervied from dinosaurs over the eons. Evolution and the origin of life has always captivated them and unlocking instaneous evolutionary mutations have provided the means of a creation of secret policemen- the False Goombas -that any Dinohattanite ruler can deploy if he possesses a De-Evolution Chamber. \n The more knowledge and understanding a Dinohattanite ruler has of evolution and de-evolution, the more power he wields. Like Prestige, one's understanding of evolution is added to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_EVOLUTION;Monthly Evolutionary Gains;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_MUSHROOM_KADABRA;Mushroom-Kadabra;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_MUSHROOM_KADABRA;Mushroom Kadabra is both an invocation in spells and the general term used for folk magic in the Mushroom World, particularly in the Dry Dry Desert. It is also used by the various genies known to inhabit the galaxy in the course of granting wishes and escourting righteous souls towards Power Stars. The antithesis of Mushroom-Kadabra is the curses of Fungus-Pocus. Like Prestige, harmonizing Mushroom-Kadabra contributes points to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

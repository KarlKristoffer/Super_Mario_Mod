Most remember them as a kind and casual people, but the harshness of the desert and depth of their faith can create the finest warrior-poets in the Odyssey Continents.

###species_moon_rabbit_desc;The tricksy extraterrestrial mammals known as Moon Rabbits are a mysterious people, that's a fact nobody can deny.

What is known about them is that they have some connection to the Stars, and seem to have originated on the Moon. Some claim them to be Lumas taking a more agile form temporarily, while others claim that they are servants of the Stars that give gifts to those they deem worthy, while yet more claim they are just that, simple rabbits who happen to live on the moon.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x###
